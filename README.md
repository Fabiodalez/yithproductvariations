<h1>WooCommerce Product Variations in Search Results</h1>
This WordPress code modifies the search logic of the YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search plugin to display product variations as individual results in the search results page. It ensures that product variations are treated as standalone products in the search results, even when using WooCommerce's built-in search functionality.

The code leverages the WooCommerce product variation data and modifies the behavior of the YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search plugin's fuzzy search feature. Instead of only displaying parent products, the code ensures that all product variations appear as distinct items in both AJAX search results and the standard WooCommerce search results page.

<h2>Features</h2> <ul> <li><b>Displays product variations</b> in the search results instead of just the parent products.</li> <li><b>Fuzzy search functionality</b> remains active for finding related results.</li> <li><b>Compatible</b> with WooCommerce and YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search.</li> <li>Works for <b> WooCommerce's normal search page</b>.</li> <li>The code is inserted in the <b>functions.php</b> file of your theme, so no need to modify the original plugin files.</li> </ul> <h2>Installation</h2> <ol> <li><b>Open your WordPress theme's `functions.php` file</b> (ideally a child theme).</li> <li><b>Copy the code</b> provided in this repository into your `functions.php`.</li> <li><b>Save the file</b> and upload it to your server if needed.</li> <li>The modifications will automatically apply to both the AJAX search and the WooCommerce search results page.</li> </ol> <h2>Usage</h2>
This code adds custom search functionality to your WooCommerce store, ensuring that product variations appear as individual items in the search results.

You do not need to modify the YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search plugin directly. The logic is handled via WordPress hooks and filters, specifically using the <b>ywcas_search_result_data</b> filter to intercept and modify the search results data.

<h2>Key Changes</h2> <ul> <li><b>Display Product Variations</b>: Each variation is treated as a separate product in the search results.</li> <li><b>Fuzzy Search Compatibility</b>: If no exact match is found, the fuzzy search is triggered to show related variations.</li> </ul> <h2>How It Works</h2> <ol> <li><b>Intercepting Search Results</b>: The code hooks into the `ywcas_search_result_data` filter to modify how search results are displayed.</li> <li><b>Custom Search Logic</b>: If no exact matches are found, the code triggers a fuzzy search to find variations that match the search term.</li> <li><b>Displaying Variations</b>: Each product variation is extracted and displayed in the search results, ensuring that users can see individual variations instead of just parent products.</li> </ol> <h2>Requirements</h2> <ul> <li><b>WooCommerce</b> (latest version)</li> <li><b>YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search</b> (latest version)</li> </ul> <h2>License</h2>
